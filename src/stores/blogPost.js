You could come to Les 3 Vallées for weeks and never ski the same slope twice; and there’s no better place to experience it all than at Courchevel! Courchevel’s four separate villages sit amongst the north-facing slopes on the left side of the map and offer probably the most balanced selection of greens, blues, reds, and blacks in the 3 Vallées, making it our top resort here. If you’re up for exploring more however, the ski area is well linked so getting to the other end isn’t too difficult.',

Get a glimpse of the majestic Arenal volcano and then soak up natural thermal hot springs with fellow adventurers after the day&rsquo;s explorations. Take in the wild and beautiful Rio Pacuare for two days of heart-pounding whitewater rafting. Spend our final day cycling through the quaint towns and fertile slopes of the Turrialba region.</p>',

You could come to Les 3 Vallées for weeks and never ski the same slope twice; and there’s no better place to experience it all than at Courchevel! Courchevel’s four separate villages sit amongst the north-facing slopes on the left side of the map and offer probably the most balanced selection of greens, blues, reds, and blacks in the 3 Vallées, making it our top resort here. If you’re up for exploring more however, the ski area is well linked so getting to the other end isn’t too difficult.',

Freestyle is snowboarding in a pipe or park filled with rails, fun boxes and other features.<br /><br />Snowboarding parks are designed for specific skill levels, from beginner parks with tiny rails hugging the ground to terrain parks with roller-coaster rails, fun boxes and tabletops for more experienced snowboarders.<br /><br />Whether you\'re a first-timer or already comfortable going lip-to-lip in a pipe, there are classes and special clinics for you at our ski and snowboard resorts. Our resorts offer multiday clinics, so if you\'re headed to ski this winter, consider wrapping your vacation dates around a snowboarding clinic.</p>",\n          "inode" : "669db9d1-9274-4fca-af61-bd54229f049c",\n          "host" : "48190c8c-42c4-46af-8d1a-0cd5db894797",\n          "locked" : false,\n          "stInode" : "778f3246-9b11-4a2a-a101-e7fdf111bdad",\n          "contentType" : "Activity",\n          "altTag" : "Snowboarding",\n          "identifier" : "574f0aec-185a-4160-9c17-6d037b298318",\n          "image" : {\n            "identifier" : "547f0ab4744d3d0122c4494031a17ebf",\n            "parent" : "48190c8c-42c4-46af-8d1a-0cd5db894797",\n            "extension" : "ukn",\n            "isContentlet" : true,\n            "description" : "",\n            "__icon__" : "941b3d89-a911-4324-a945-5ebc79921e5bIcon",\n            "mimeType" : "application/octet-stream",\n            "statusIcons" : "<span class=\'greyDotIcon\' style=\'opacity:.4\'></span><span class=\'liveIcon\'></span>",\n            "type" : "file_asset",\n            "metaData" : { },\n            "path" : "/",\n            "size" : 0,\n            "name" : "content.941b3d89-a911-4324-a945-5ebc79921e5b",\n            "underlyingFileName" : null\n          },\n          "urlTitle" : "snowboarding",\n          "publishUserName" : "Admin User",\n          "publishUser" : "dotcms.org.1",\n          "creationDate" : "2020-09-02 16:42:07.605",\n          "tags" : "snowboarding,winterenthusiast",\n          "folder" : "SYSTEM_FOLDER",\n          "hasTitleImage" : true,\n          "sortOrder" : 0,\n          "hostName" : "demo.dotcms.com",\n          "modDate" : "2024-06-19 19:15:58.591",\n          "description" : "Snowboarding, once a prime route for teen rebellion, today is definitely mainstream.
